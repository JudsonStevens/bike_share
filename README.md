# Bike-Share

## Bike-Share on Heroku

This project simulates a bike accessory shop and also contains information about trips and stations from a bike share platform located in San Francisco. If you would like to see this code in action, you can visit our [Heroku deployed app](https://thawing-peak-97979.herokuapp.com/). If you would like to browse the site as a registered user, you can create an account by clicking on 'Log In' and then clicking on 'Create A New Account.' If you would like to browse the site as an admin, you can use the username - 'admin@gamil.com' and password - 'admin' to log in and browse the site as an admin, giving you access to different areas of the site.
